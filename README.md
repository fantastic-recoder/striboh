IDL based middleware utilising ReST and WebSockets.

## Why (yet another) a code generator?
When connecting two completely different languages like for example C++ and JavaScript, there are basically 3 solutions:
1) Code generation - more later.
2) Using dynamic runtime - let, for example the Javascript client be on the fly generated by the C++ backend. C++ backend 
   can be configured at runtime as well.

There is currently no easy way to use C++ backend and Typescript/Angular frontend/client middleware.
C++ still lacks reflections and they are not in C++20. Current C++ template based reflection 
solutions like for example Boost Hana, are incredibly complex and result in hard to debug code. 

#### Note
Build Boost for Win 10 target  "b2 --build-dir=C:\dev\boost_1_78_0_build --toolset=msvc --build-type=complete define=BOOST_USE_WINAPI_VERSION=0x0501=0x0A00 stage install".
Boost 1.78.1 cannot handle C++20 because of allocator::pointer
