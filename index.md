# The Striboh Project.

## Introduction

The project repository can bo found [here](https://github.com/gogoba/striboh). Striboh is a [IDL](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnittstellenbeschreibungssprache) based [middleware](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware). The first design goal was to make efficient communication between [Angular](https://angular.io/) and C++ backend. Because it is meant to be multilanguage, with multiple backens and frontends I decided to base the design on code generator and own "Striboh IDL". 

## Purpose (why)

...Is to create an open source, modern, easy to tinker with, good documented (even the inner workings), easy to use, efficient middleware, based on binary protocols like [Msgpack](https://msgpack.org/) and/or [Hessian](http://hessian.caucho.com/). The first milestone is to connect Angular with C++ via Msgpack.

## Principles ##

1. Use modern tools. No legacy.
2. Do not reinvent the wheel. Use what there is.
3. Good documentation based on source code.
4. Release often and early (more in [Focus](#Focus))

## Vision / outcome ##

Good, solid, performant base for complex, distributed, (web) applications.

## Focus

Release offten, release early, do not worry to break things but innovate.
